### Hi there, I'm Oleg 👋

I'm a **Senior iOS/macOS Developer**, a bit of a **Security Engineer**, and a passionate **Indie Hacker**.  
Currently looking for new opportunities and building my own tiny empire of apps 🧪📱

---

🛠️ **Tech I work with:**
- `Swift` (my daily driver 🚗)
- `Objective-C` (yes, still!)
- `C` (when I'm feeling spicy 🌶️)

---

🎯 **Current focus:**
- Searching for a job where I can build cool stuff and not just fight with Jira
- Launching a few indie apps (because why not break things for fun and profit)

🐙 **Fun fact:**  
I once tried to write clean code in Objective-C. I’m still recovering.
